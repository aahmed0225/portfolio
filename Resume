	<p>I am currently studying Python, Java and Web html in three seperate classes. I am hoping that learning all three of these will help me become a well rounded programmer with several options in the future. I am still figuring out which of the three I am most interested in but as of right now I can't say I specialize in any one specifically.</p>
